Converts python code to anki cards

This is targeted towards people who want to use anki to learn interview question using spaced repetition. Im trying to merge this with my current directories of python files so that i dont have to make cards manually. 
Also, this code is meant to only serve as a utility so that some other code can keep records of what codes are turned into cards already and with just one command add the newer programs to anki.

## Technologies Used:
[Pygments](https://pygments.org/) : Syntax highlighting 

[Syntax-Highlighting FORK](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1972239816) : Add-on for Anki

## Anki Card configuration
### Card Layout
The card has to have three fields 
1. Question
2. Answer
3. Code

### Add-Ons
I haven't tried [Syntax-Highlighting](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1463041493) but the forked version seems more bug free which is why i went with that
